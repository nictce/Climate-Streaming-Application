    "*Write a python program that loads all the data from hotspot_TERRA_streaming.csv and randomly (with replacement) feeds the data to the stream every 2 seconds. TERRA is another satellite from NASA that reports latitude, longitude, confidence and surface temperature of a location. You will need to append additional information such as producer information to identify the producer and created date & time.*"
